This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on October 27, 2020 at 1:56 AM GMT

It includes 395 images.
Toys are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -29 and +29 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
